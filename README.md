# MqttToBomWow
Publish data from a Mqtt Broker to the Bureau of Meteorology Weather Observations Website

The Bureau of Meteorology provide the [Weather Observations Website (WOW)] (http://bom-wow.metoffice.gov.uk/) to enable the public to lodge and share weather observations, information and photos from personal weather stations.

The Python code subscribes to weather observations from my weather station and formats the reports for publishing to WOW.

Code is no longer maintained in this repository and can be found at https://github.com/greenthegarden/MqttWiFlyWeatherBoard/tree/master/python.
